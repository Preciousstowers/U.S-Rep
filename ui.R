    state representatives and a summary page. The overview page introduces the 
    programmer to the user, including their name, affiliation, what the 
    program does and some of the struggles the programmer went through in 
    order to complete the application. The state representatives page 
    consists of two working widgets, a drop down the state codes and 
    another with the representative ids, in which the user can select 
    a state or a representative and an table will pop up with the 
    representatives of the state and/or details about the representative."),

    interactive with two bar charts. The user is able to pick a state and the
    bar charts will show the democratic vs. republican state representatives
    and female vs. male representatives. This cis the closing of the 
    application, because it provides the user with a general and base line idea
    with who the state representatives are, where they are located and

      code itself to be continuously hard. For example, creating the bar graphs using ggplot 
      to be interactive using only one widget was one of the functions that took myself multiple
      hours to create, despite it being such a small function. In order to find my solution, 
      I realized that I needed to pay attention to the details and not rush through creating a program.
